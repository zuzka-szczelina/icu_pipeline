    "## Parameters selection\n",
    "\n",
    "I determined two main approaches in which time series data describing vital signs could be utilized to potentially help nurses with patient care:\n",
    "1. using a combination of multiple parameters as input for Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the aim to distinguish between stable and unstable patient's condition (raise warnings when unstable condition is detected therefore increasing probability of it being spotted earlier).\n",
    "2. using one time series as input for Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the aim to predict value in the next time step and therefore raise warnings before dangerous condition occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of this approaches needed to me consulted with nurse expert.\\\n",
    "On the basis of the previous steps I could see that quality of parameters records varied significantly. Parameters most suitable to be adapted for ML purposes needed to be selected. However, there was a risk that selecting only a few parameters would result in inability to predict patients condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "I consulted the nurse expert on both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DNN approach: to find out whether few parameters combination carries a meaningful information on patients condition I asked the nurse whether she would be able to determine patients condition deterioration on the basis of this parameters. I received an affirmative answer. Therefore I assumed that there is a chance that DNN could depict the same process of condition determining.\n",
    "2. RNN approach: On the basis of consultations I could conclude that it is of use to predict next time step value of a single parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking into account the quality of data and expert knowledge on their medical significance I selected few parameters for further project parts. Those parameters are: pulse, systolic and diastolic pressure, oxygen saturation, central venous pressure (CVP), total breaths and controlled breaths (breaths delivered according to the set respiratory rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the above-mentioned parameters are selected from initial 'df_all.csv' and saved as 'df.csv'"
